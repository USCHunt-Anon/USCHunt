    Changelog
    V1.1
    - Verify amount unrolled from strategy positions on withdraw() is within a threshold relative to the requested amount as a sanity check
    - Add version number which is displayed with baseStrategyVersion(). If a strategy does not implement this function, it can be assumed to be 1.0

    V1.2
    - Remove idle want handling from base withdraw() function. This should be handled as the strategy sees fit in _withdrawSome()
