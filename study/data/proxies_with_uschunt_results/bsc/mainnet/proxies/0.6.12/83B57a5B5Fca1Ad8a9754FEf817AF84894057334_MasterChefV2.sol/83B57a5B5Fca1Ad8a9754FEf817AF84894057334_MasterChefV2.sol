/**
 * @dev Wrappers over Solidity's arithmetic operations with added overflow
 * checks.
 *
 * Arithmetic operations in Solidity wrap on overflow. This can easily result
 * in bugs, because programmers usually assume that an overflow raises an
 * error, which is the standard behavior in high level programming languages.
 * `SafeMath` restores this intuition by reverting the transaction when an
 * operation overflows.
 *
 * Using this library instead of the unchecked operations eliminates an entire
 * class of bugs, so it's recommended to use it always.

// MasterChef 2.0: MasterChefV2 Security Enhanced

//MasterChef 2.0 is an experimental decentralized system governed by decentralized autonomous organization(DAO). 

// BEP20 >= $1,000
// BEP20_STAKE == $1

// Completely removed the trust of the owner.
//
// 1.Removed migrator() function
//
// 2.All configuration functions are 720-hour timelocked

// 3.How to check whether all governance functions are locked or not: 

// Call TIMELOCK() with fucntion id, eg: "1", to check if "add()" is locked. If the returned value is 0, it is locked. If the returned value is not 0, it would be the timestamp 720 hours after calling the unlock() tx. And when the current timestamp is larger than the returned timestamp, the owner can call the unlocked functions.

// Below is the id list of all governance functions that can be unlocked/locked. By default, all functions are locked and all returned values of the functions available for the owner are 0.

//    0    :   airdropByOwner()
//    1    :   add()
//    2    :   addList()
//    3    :   setToken()
//    4    :   set()
//    5    :   setList()
//    6    :   updateMultiplier()
//    7    :   updateEmissionRate()
//    8    :   upgrade()

// 4.How to unlock one specific function:
//    Owner calls unlock() function with a specific function id, eg: owner unlocks "upgrade()" through calling "unlock()" with "8" as its parameter. And the community can check the lock/unlock status via calling TIMELOCK() with "8" as parameter.

// 5.Restrictions of using unlocked functions:

    // a. Every time the owner calls the unlocked function, it would be 720-hour locked again automatically. It means the owner can not regularly change the underlying protocol.

    // b.Owner can NOT change _allocation point into an infinite number
    // require (_allocPoint <= 200 && _depositFeeBP <= 500, 'add: invalid allocpoints or deposit fee basis points');

    // c.Owner can NOT set deposit fee higher than 5%
    // uint256 depositFee = _amount.mul(pool.depositFeeBP).div(10000);
    // require (_allocPoint <= 5000 && _depositFeeBP <= 500, 'set: invalid allocpoints or deposit fee basis points');

    // d.Owner can NOT set multiplier higher than 5
    // require(multiplierNumber <= 5, 'multipler too high');

    // e.Owner can NOT set emission rate higher than the initial bep20 per block
    // require(_bep20PerBlock <= 1000000000000000000, 'must be smaller than the initial emission rate');

    // f.upgrade() function should NOT be unlocked unless it is really necessary to upgrade the protocol. The returned value of calling TIMELOCK() with parameter "8" should ALWAYS be 0.

    // g.In fact, to achieve maximum security, all returned values for calling TIMELOCK() with parameters from 0 to 8 should be 0, which means all governance functions are perfectly locked.
