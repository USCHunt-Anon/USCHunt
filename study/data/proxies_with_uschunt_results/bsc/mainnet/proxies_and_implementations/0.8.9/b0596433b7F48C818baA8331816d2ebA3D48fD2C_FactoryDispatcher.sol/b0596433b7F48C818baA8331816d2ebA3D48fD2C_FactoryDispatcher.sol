 * @dev Library for reading and writing primitive types to specific storage slots.

 *
 * Example usage to set ERC1967 implementation slot:
 * ```
 * contract ERC1967 {
 *     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;

 *         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;
