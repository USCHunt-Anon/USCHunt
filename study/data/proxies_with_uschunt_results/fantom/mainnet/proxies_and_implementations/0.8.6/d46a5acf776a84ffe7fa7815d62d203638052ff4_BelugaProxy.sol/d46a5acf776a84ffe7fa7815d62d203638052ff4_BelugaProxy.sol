 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide

 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin guidelines: functions revert instead
 * of returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless conventional
 * and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20 applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

    // aware of the Pools' pricing algorithms in order to estimate the prices Pools will quote.
    //
    // The `swap` function executes a single swap, while `batchSwap` can perform multiple swaps in sequence.
    // In each individual swap, tokens of one kind are sent from the sender to the Pool (this is the 'token in'),
    // and tokens of another kind are sent from the Pool to the recipient in exchange (this is the 'token out').
    // More complex swaps, such as one token in to multiple tokens out can be achieved by batching together
    // individual swaps.
    //
    // There are two swap kinds:
    //  - 'given in' swaps, where the amount of tokens in (sent to the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines (via the
    // `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens out (to send to the recipient).
    //  - 'given out' swaps, where the amount of tokens out (received from the Pool) is known, and the Pool determines
    // (via the `onSwap` hook) the amount of tokens in (to receive from the sender).
    //
    // Additionally, it is possible to chain swaps using a placeholder input amount, which the Vault replaces with
    // the calculated output of the previous swap. If the previous swap was 'given in', this will be the calculated
    // tokenOut amount. If the previous swap was 'given out', it will use the calculated tokenIn amount. These extended
    // swaps are known as 'multihop' swaps, since they 'hop' through a number of intermediate tokens before arriving at
    // the final intended token.
    //
    // In all cases, tokens are only transferred in and out of the Vault (or withdrawn from and deposited into Internal
    // Balance) after all individual swaps have been completed, and the net token balance change computed. This makes
    // certain swap patterns, such as multihops, or swaps that interact with the same token pair in multiple Pools, cost
    // much less gas than they would otherwise.
    //
    // It also means that under certain conditions it is possible to perform arbitrage by swapping with multiple
    // Pools in a way that results in net token movement out of the Vault (profit), with no tokens being sent in (only
    // updating the Pool's internal accounting).
    //
    // To protect users from front-running or the market changing rapidly, they supply a list of 'limits' for each token
    // involved in the swap, where either the maximum number of tokens to send (by passing a positive value) or the
    // minimum amount of tokens to receive (by passing a negative value) is specified.
    //
    // Additionally, a 'deadline' timestamp can also be provided, forcing the swap to fail if it occurs after
    // this point in time (e.g. if the transaction failed to be included in a block promptly).
    //
    // If interacting with Pools that hold WETH, it is possible to both send and receive ETH directly: the Vault will do
    // the wrapping and unwrapping. To enable this mechanism, the IAsset sentinel value (the zero address) must be

     * Vault, and negative amounts represent tokens (or ETH) sent by the Vault. Each delta corresponds to the asset at
     * the same index in the `assets` array.
     *
     * Swaps are executed sequentially, in the order specified by the `swaps` array. Each array element describes a
     * Pool, the token to be sent to this Pool, the token to receive from it, and an amount that is either `amountIn` or
     * `amountOut` depending on the swap kind.
     *
     * Multihop swaps can be executed by passing an `amount` value of zero for a swap. This will cause the amount in/out
     * of the previous swap to be used as the amount in for the current one. In a 'given in' swap, 'tokenIn' must equal
     * the previous swap's `tokenOut`. For a 'given out' swap, `tokenOut` must equal the previous swap's `tokenIn`.
     *
     * The `assets` array contains the addresses of all assets involved in the swaps. These are either token addresses,
     * or the IAsset sentinel value for ETH (the zero address). Each entry in the `swaps` array specifies tokens in and
     * out by referencing an index in `assets`. Note that Pools never interact with ETH directly: it will be wrapped to
     * or unwrapped from WETH by the Vault.
     *
     * Internal Balance usage, sender, and recipient are determined by the `funds` struct. The `limits` array specifies
     * the minimum or maximum amount of each token the vault is allowed to transfer.
     *
     * `batchSwap` can be used to make a single swap, like `swap` does, but doing so requires more gas than the
     * equivalent `swap` call.
