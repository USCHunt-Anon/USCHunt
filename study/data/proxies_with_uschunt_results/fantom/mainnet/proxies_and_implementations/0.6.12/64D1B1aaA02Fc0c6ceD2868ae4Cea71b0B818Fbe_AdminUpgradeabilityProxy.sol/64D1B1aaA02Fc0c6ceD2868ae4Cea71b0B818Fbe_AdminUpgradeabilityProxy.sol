// Part: Vault

/*
    Source: https://github.com/iearn-finance/yearn-protocol/blob/develop/contracts/vaults/yVault.sol
    
    Changelog:

    V1.1
    * Strategist no longer has special function calling permissions
    * Version function added to contract
    * All write functions, with the exception of transfer, are pausable
    * Keeper or governance can pause
    * Only governance can unpause

    V1.2
    * Transfer functions are now pausable along with all other non-permissioned write functions
    * All permissioned write functions, with the exception of pause() & unpause(), are pausable as well

    V1.3
    * Add guest list functionality
    * All deposits can be optionally gated by external guestList approval logic on set guestList contract

    V1.4
    * Add depositFor() to deposit on the half of other users. That user will then be blockLocked.

    V1.5
    * Removed Controller
        - Removed harvest from vault (only on strategy)
    * Params added to track autocompounded rewards (lifeTimeEarned, lastHarvestedAt, lastHarvestAmount, assetsAtLastHarvest)
      this would work in sync with autoCompoundRatio to help us track harvests better.
    * Fees
        - Strategy would report the autocompounded harvest amount to the vault
        - Calculation performanceFeeGovernance, performanceFeeStrategist, withdrawalFee, managementFee moved to the vault.
        - Vault mints shares for performanceFees and managementFee to the respective recipient (treasury, strategist)
        - withdrawal fees is transferred to the rewards address set
    * Permission:
        - Strategist can now set performance, withdrawal and management fees
        - Governance will determine maxPerformanceFee, maxWithdrawalFee, maxManagementFee that can be set to prevent rug of funds.
    * Strategy would take the actors from the vault it is connected to
    * All goverance related fees goes to treasury
