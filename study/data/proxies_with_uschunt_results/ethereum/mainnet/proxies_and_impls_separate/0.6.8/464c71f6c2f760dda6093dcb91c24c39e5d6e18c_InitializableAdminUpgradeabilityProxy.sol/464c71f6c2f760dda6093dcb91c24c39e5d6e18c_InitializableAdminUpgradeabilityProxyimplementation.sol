 * @title AaveEcosystemReserve v2

 * Modification of Sablier https://github.com/sablierhq/sablier/blob/develop/packages/protocol/contracts/Sablier.sol
 * Original can be found also deployed on https://etherscan.io/address/0xCD18eAa163733Da39c232722cBC4E8940b1D8888
 * Modifications:
 * - Sablier "pulls" the funds from the creator of the stream at creation. In the Aave case, we already have the funds.
 * - Anybody can create streams on Sablier. Here, only the funds admin (Aave governance via controller) can
 * - Adapted codebase to Solidity 0.8.11, mainly removing SafeMath and CarefulMath to use native safe math
 * - Same as with creation, on Sablier the `sender` and `recipient` can cancel a stream. Here, only fund admin and recipient
