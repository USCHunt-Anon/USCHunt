 * These properties mean that the admin account can only be used for admin actions like upgrading the proxy or changing

/**
 * @dev This is a base contract to aid in writing upgradeable contracts, or any kind of contract that will be deployed
 * behind a proxy. Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an
 * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer
 * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.
 *
 * The initialization functions use a version number. Once a version number is used, it is consumed and cannot be
 * reused. This mechanism prevents re-execution of each "step" but allows the creation of new initialization steps in
 * case an upgrade adds a module that needs to be initialized.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * contract MyToken is ERC20Upgradeable {
 *     function initialize() initializer public {
 *         __ERC20_init("MyToken", "MTK");
 *     }
 * }
 * contract MyTokenV2 is MyToken, ERC20PermitUpgradeable {
 *     function initializeV2() reinitializer(2) public {
 *         __ERC20Permit_init("MyToken");
 *     }
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as
 * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.
 *
 * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure
 * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.
 *
 * [CAUTION]
 * ====
 * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.
 *
 * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation
 * contract, which may impact the proxy. To prevent the implementation contract from being used, you should invoke
 * the {_disableInitializers} function in the constructor to automatically lock it when it is deployed:
 *
 * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]
 * ```
 * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor
 * constructor() {
 *     _disableInitializers();

    /**
     * @dev Here is the overall flow for a cross-chain dApp that integrates Rango + cBridgeIM:
     * Example case: RangoSea is an imaginary cross-chain OpenSea that users can lock their NFT on BSC to get 100 BNB
     * and convert it to FTM to buy another NFT there, all in one TX.
     * RangoSea contract = RS
     * Rango contract = R
     *
     * 1. RangoSea server asks Rango for a quote of 100 BSC.BNB to Fantom.FTM and embeds the message (imMessage.dAppMessage) that should be received by RS on destination
     * 2. User signs sellNFTandBuyCrosschain on RS
     * 3. RS executes their own logic and locks the NFT, gets 100 BNB and calls R with the hex from step 1 (which is cBridgeIM function call)
     * 4. R on source chain does the required swap/bridge
     * 5. R on destination receives the message via Celer network (by calling RangoCBridge.executeMessageWithTransfer on dest) and does other Rango internal stuff on destination to have the final FTM
     * 6. R on dest sends fund to RS on dest and calls their handler function for message handling and passes imMessage.dAppMessage to it
     * 7. RS on destination has the money and the message it needs to buy the NFT on destination and if it is still available it will be purchased
     *
     * Failure scenarios:
     * If cBridge does not have enough liquidity later:
     * 1. Celer network will call (RangoCBridge on source chain).executeMessageWithTransferRefund function
     * 2. RangoCbridge will refund money to the RS contract on source and ask it to handle refund to their own users
     *
     * If something on the destination fails:
     * 1. Celer network will call (RangoCBridge on dest chain).executeMessageWithTransferFallback function
     * 2. R on dest sends fund to RS on dest with refund reason, again RS should send it to your user if you like
     *
     * Hint: The dAppMessage part is arbitrary, if it's not set. The scenario is the same as above but without RS being in. In this case Rango will refund to the end-user.
     * Here is the celer IM docs: https://im-docs.celer.network/
