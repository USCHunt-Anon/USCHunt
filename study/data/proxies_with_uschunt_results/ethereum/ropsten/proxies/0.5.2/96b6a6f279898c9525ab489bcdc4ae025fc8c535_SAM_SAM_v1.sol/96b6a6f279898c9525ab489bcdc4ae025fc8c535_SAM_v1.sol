// ======================= CORE FUNCTIONS ============================//

    'Software Assent Management' smart contract with following functions
        => Multi-ownership control
        => Higher degree of control by owner
        => Upgradeability using Unstructured Storage

// ========================= CORE LOGIC ==============================//
    
    (1) Four types of account management -
        (a) Software vendors/developers
        (b) businesses
        (c) employees
        (d) owner of the contract
    (2) Owner of the contract is supreme controller, who is highest authority to change
    addresses of all other types of accounts/wallets.
        (a) Process begins when owner of contract creates SW vendor account (which is
        just an ETH wallet address).
        (b) Then that authorised vendor can add/remove/update businesses account
        information (which again is ethereum wallet address) to whom licence is
        provided.
        (c) Businesses then can add/remove/update employees to view licence
        information.
    (3) Software vendor or developer will first submit licence information in smart contract.
    (4) Authorised employees of the company (business, vendor, owner) can look up for
    any licence information.
    (5) There will not events will be logged, because all the data is private to view for the Authorised bodies.
