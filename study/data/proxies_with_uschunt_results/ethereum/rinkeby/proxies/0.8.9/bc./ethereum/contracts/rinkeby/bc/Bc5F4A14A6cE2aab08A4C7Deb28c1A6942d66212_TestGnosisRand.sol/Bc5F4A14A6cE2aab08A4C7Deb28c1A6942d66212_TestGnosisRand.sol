  * @dev Library for reading and writing primitive types to specific storage slots.
  *
  * Storage slots are often used to avoid storage conflict when dealing with upgradeable contracts.
  * This library helps with reading and writing to such slots without the need for inline assembly.
  *
  * The functions in this library return Slot structs that contain a "value" member that can be used to read or write.
  *
  * Example usage to set ERC1967 implementation slot:
  * 
  * contract ERC1967 {
  *     bytes32 internal constant _IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT = 0x360894a13ba1a3210667c828492db98dca3e2076cc3735a920a3ca505d382bbc;

  *     function _getImplementation() internal view returns (address) {
  *         return StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value;

  *     function _setImplementation(address newImplementation) internal {

  *         StorageSlot.getAddressSlot(_IMPLEMENTATION_SLOT).value = newImplementation;

 *
 * This ERC721A is set up to better handle batch transactions. It has two layers of optimization:
 *
 * First, it assumes tokens are sequentially minted starting at _startTokenId() (defaults to 0, e.g. 0, 1, 2, 3..)
 * which allows for up to 5 times cheaper MINT gas fees, but does increase first time TRANSFER gas fees.
 * Because of this, methods have also been optimized to only call ownerOf() once as it is not a direct lookup.
 *
 * Second, it allows a permanent switch to non-sequential mint with still reduced fees because the {_mint}
 * only updates {_owners} and not {_balances} so that a batch mint method can update _balances a single time.
 *
 * Additionally assumes that an owner cannot have more than 2**128 - 1 (max value of uint128) of supply.

 * Easely will help power the lazy-selling as well as lazy minting that take place on
 * directly on the collection, which is why we take a cut of these transactions. Our cut can
 * be publically seen in the connected EaselyPayout contract and cannot exceed 5%.
 *
 * Owners also set a dual signer which they can change at any time. This dual signer helps enable
 * sales for large batches of addresses without needing to manually sign hundreds or thousands of hashes.
 * It also makes phishing scams harder as both signatures need to be compromised before an unwanted sale can occur.
 *
 * Owner also has an option to allow token owners to loan their tokens to other users which makes the token
 * untradeable until the original owner reclaims the token.
